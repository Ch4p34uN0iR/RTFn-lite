INSTALL / RUN

Download Etherpad-lite (as a submodule?):
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update

Optional!!! Instead of using the submodule:
Download Etherpad-lite to a directory that RTFn will have read/write access:
$ git clone https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite.git etherpad-lite

Install Python/Cherrypy (>3.2.0), e.g.:
$ apt-get install python-cherrypy3 

Configure settings.json (copy settings.json.template to settings.json), 
by default you only need to change the "password" setting.

1. Create your first RTFn-lite competition, this will setup the database
and copy settings from RTFn-lite to Etherpad-Lite.

$ python ./rlite.py --add <competition name> --key <access key>

2. Follow the directions to install Etherpad-Lite's dependencies.

3. (Optional) Install Etherpad-Lite as a service.
[https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite/wiki/How-to-deploy-Etherpad-Lite-as-a-service]

4. Setup Apache to proxy Etherpad-Lite. Right now RTFn-Lite expects 
this configuration for SSL support. Use 127.0.0.0.1 for the host.

5. Start RTFn-Lite!

$ python ./rlite.py
