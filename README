INSTALL / RUN

Download Etherpad-lite to a directory that RTFn will have read/write access:
$ git clone https://github.com/Pita/etherpad-lite.git etherpad-lite

Install Python/Cherrypy, e.g.:
$ apt-get install python-cherrypy 

Configure settings.json (copy settings.json.template to settings.json), 
by default you only need to change the "password" setting.

Then use RLITE or RLITE-SIMPLE

RLITE-SIMPLE

rLite Simple is a very basic layout for your pads. It does not use the Etherpad
Lite API, but instead just scrapes the dirty DB flat file, while maintaining its
own dirty DB for naming/labeling. 

Configure your HOST in ./rlite-simple.py, and the httpAuth USERNAME:PASSWORD

Copy the settings.json.simple to ./etherpad-lite/ (assuming you installed Etherpad
Lite using the INSTALL / RUN directions. Then run Etherpad Lite

$ nohup ./etherpad-lite/bin/run.sh
$ python ./rlite-simple.py

Navigate to http://"your host ip":9000

RLITE

$ python ./rlite.py
